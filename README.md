# Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and any other related projects that I've developed on the side, or that aren't part of a larger framework. Most code makes use of the [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow "Tensorflow") and [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) libraries.
