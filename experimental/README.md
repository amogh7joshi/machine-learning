# Experimental Research

This directory contains implementations of certain machine learning constructs with 
different types of algorithms, which often do not provide the best output result. 

This is for personal experimentation, to determine which algorithms do not function properly, but more
importantly, *why* they do not function properly.

If you want to use any of the algorithms in this directory, please first read the top of the implementation 
files, which discusses whether the algorithms are successful or not, and if not, exactly *why* they are unsuccessful.
Otherwise, you may end up using algorithms that product a far-from-expected output.
